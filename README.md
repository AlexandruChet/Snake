Functions

createFood()

Generates food at a random position on the board.
Coordinates are multiples of unitSize to align with the snake.

drawFood()

Draws food as a circle with a radial gradient for visual effect.

gameStart()

Starts the game:

resets the score,

creates food,

starts the main game loop with nextTick().


nextTick()

Main game loop:

1. Clears the board (clearBoard()),


2. Draws the food (drawFood()),


3. Moves the snake (moveSnake()),


4. Draws the snake (drawSnake()),


5. Checks for game over (checkGameOver()),


6. Recursively calls itself every 100ms if the game is still running.



clearBoard()

Clears the board and adds a linear gradient background.

drawSnake()

Draws the snake:

Head ‚Äì dark green

Body ‚Äì light green

With a stroke outline for contrast.


moveSnake()

Updates the snake's position:

Otherwise, removes the last segment to maintain length.


changeDirection(event)

Controls the snake with arrow keys:

LEFT (37), UP (38), RIGHT (39), DOWN (40)

Prevents moving in the opposite direction.


checkGameOver()

Checks if:

the snake hits a wall,

the snake collides with itself.
If so, sets running = false.
